# youtube-script
I'll be stuck on my 10 year old Thinkpad X60 for the next few weeks. This thing can't view Youtube videos smoothly with the browser, so I wrote a quick script to view them with mpv and youtube-dl. I recommend installing the Firefox addon "Open With" so that you can open links simply by right-clicking them. 

Requirements:
mpv
youtube-dl
bash (I think)
